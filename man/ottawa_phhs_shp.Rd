\details{
"The Pseudo-Household Demographic Distribution is a geospatial representative
distribution of demographic data (population and households) derived from the
Canadian Census from Statistics Canada. Demography is distributed within
Dissemination Blocks along roadways, providing a more accurate geospatial
distribution while still aligning with published Census geographies.
Pseudo-household demographics are currently used to calculate broadband
Internet service availability, but are equally applicable to other
disciplines requiring a spatial distribution of households or population."
